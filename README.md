This repository contains examples of uncommon assembly errors, including out-of-bounds memory access, integer overflow, and invalid memory writes. Each error is demonstrated with a simple assembly program, along with a solution that corrects the error.  The examples are designed to be educational, illustrating potential pitfalls to watch out for during assembly language development.
